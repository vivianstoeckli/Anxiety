# Anxiety
This repository consists of a algorithm used to calculate ML-features to classify between anxiety and non-anxiety in ECG and RSP data. 
Additionally it consists of 2 functions used in said algorithm.

# Abstract:
This study innovatively assesses anxiety disorders using wearable devices, specifically exploring Electrocardiography (ECG) and Respiration Signal (RSP). Novel features derived from Hilbert and Wavelet transforms are introduced to enhance anxiety detection. Data preprocessing involves signal segmentation, categorization, and the application of a sliding window technique. Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and Respiration Rate Variability (RRV) are extracted alongside features from the Hilbert and Wavelet transforms, never previously employed for anxiety classification. The dataset is divided into training (80\%) and test (20\%) subsets, and feature selection is conducted through ANOVA. Machine learning models are trained, yielding remarkable results. The ensemble model (Subspace k-nearest neighbors (KNN)) achieves 99.8\% accuracy, support vector machine at 99.6\%, KNN at 99.3\% and the Neural Network at 99.0\% using the complete feature set. Additionally, a random forest ranking method is applied to reduce feature dimensionality and computing time, resulting in an accuracy of 0.999 and a Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.997 with a selected set of 8 new features. These outcomes highlight the effectiveness of the introduced features from Hilbert and Wavelet transforms in enhancing anxiety detection, providing both accuracy and computational efficiency.

# Code Describtion
The repository hosts the source code for the research presented in the master thesis titled "Towards instantaneous detection of anxiety with ECG and RSP data." It comprises four primary codes, 'Data Preprocessing with Feature extraction', 'Feature Ranking Method', a code to prepare the data for classification called 'Classification Preparation' and a 'Classification Analysis' in addition to various examples demonstrating their application. The 'Data Preprocessing with Feature extraction' specifically developed for the purposes of this study, offers a possibility for the user to filter the data with a suggested filter or by building an own, furthermore it segments the data into windows and extracts 58 features from the ECG or Respiratory data.
